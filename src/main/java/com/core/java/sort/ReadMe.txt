* In Java, built-in sorting methods provide efficient ways to sort primitive data types and arrays, making it easy to
    manage and manipulate collections of data
* Arrays.sort(), Collections.sort() can be used to sort primitive data types and array.
* However, when it comes to sorting custom objects, such as instances of user-defined classes, the built-in sorting methods fall short.
* These methods don’t know how to order objects based on custom criteria. This is where Java’s Comparable and Comparator interfaces come
 into play, allowing developers to define and implement custom sorting logic tailored to specific requirements.
