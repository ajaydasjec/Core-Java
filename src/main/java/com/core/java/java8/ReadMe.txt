Java 8 Features:
================
1. forEach() method in iterable interface
2.default and static method in interfaces
3.Functional Interface and Lambda expression
4.Java Stream API for bulk data operation on collection
5.Java Time API
6.Collection API improvement
7.Concurrency API improvement
8.Java IO improvement
==================================
1. forEach() => Java 8 has introduce forEach() method in java.util.lang.Iterable interface so that
while writing code we focus on business logic. forEach() takes java.util.function.Consumer object as an argument.

2.default and static method in Interface => Before java 8 Interface can not have method body.
From java 8 interface are enhanced to have method with implementation. we can use default and static
keyword to create method with implementation.

3.Functional Interface and lambda expression ==> Functional interface is the new concept in java 8. An interface with
exactly one abstract method is called functional interface. we can annotate it @FunctionalInterface.
Since Functional Interface has only one abstract class, Lambda expression can easily provide the implementation.
