How do you find duplicate in a table => Use group by or count in having command

Delete same row
WITH CTE AS(
   SELECT [col1], [col2], [col3], [col4], [col5], [col6], [col7],
       RN = ROW_NUMBER()OVER(PARTITION BY col1 ORDER BY col1)
   FROM dbo.Table1
)
DELETE FROM CTE WHERE RN > 1

What is difference between UNION and UNION ALL => Union is removing duplicate while UNION all keeps
