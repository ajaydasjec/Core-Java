S.O.L.I.D
S=>Single Responsibility Principle
   - A class should have only one reason to change
O=> Open for extension closed for modification
    - Software entities (class, module, function) should be open for extension and closed for modification
L=>Liskov substitution principle
    -Derived or child class must be substitutable for their base or parent class
I=>Interface Segregation principle
    -DO not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them.
D=>Dependency Inversion Principle
    - High level module should not be dependent on low level module, both should depend on abstraction
